# WAFA Assessment — Requirements Specification

## Overview

Build a Well-Architected Foundations Assessment (WAFA) tool that evaluates an AWS Organization's multi-account architecture against best practices. The tool runs as a CodeBuild project deployed via CloudFormation, produces an HTML report stored in S3, and requires only read-only assessment access to the customer's management account.

WAFA is inspired by the Cloud Foundation Assessment pattern, but its implementation, report names, and deployment flow are defined by this repository.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Deployment

- FR-1.1: Deploy via a single CloudFormation template in the customer's AWS account (management account recommended)
- FR-1.2: CloudFormation creates these resources:
  - IAM Role with explicit read-only permissions (see "AWS API Permissions Required" section)
  - CodeBuild project (Python 3.12 runtime, `aws/codebuild/standard:7.0` image)
  - S3 bucket (encrypted AES256, public access blocked, versioning enabled)
  - Optional: SNS topic (created only if `EmailAddress` parameter is provided)
  - Lambda-backed Custom Resource that starts the first CodeBuild run
  - The deployment script creates and uploads the source S3 bucket/object before deploying the stack; the stack does not clone a Git repository.
- FR-1.3: CodeBuild triggers automatically on stack creation via a Custom Resource Lambda:
  - Lambda defined inline in CloudFormation (ZipFile property), runtime `python3.12`
  - Handler calls `codebuild.start_build(projectName=...)` on the project created in the same stack
  - Lambda IAM role has only `codebuild:StartBuild` permission scoped to the project ARN
  - On CloudFormation Delete: Lambda is a no-op (returns SUCCESS without action)
- FR-1.4: Support manual re-run: customer clicks "Start build" in CodeBuild console
- FR-1.5: Auto-detect partition from the configured AWS region (`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`; region discovery also accepts `AWS_REGION`):
  - `us-gov-*` regions → `aws-us-gov` partition, default region `us-gov-west-1`
  - `cn-*` regions → `aws-cn` partition, default region `cn-north-1`
  - All other → `aws` partition, default region `us-east-1`

### FR-2: Account Discovery

- FR-2.1: Call `sts.getCallerIdentity()` to get current account ID
- FR-2.2: Call `organizations.describeOrganization()`:
  - If succeeds: account is in an org. Compare `Organization.MasterAccountId` with current account ID
  - If `MasterAccountId == currentAccountId`: this IS the management account → run ALL checks
  - If `MasterAccountId != currentAccountId`: this is a MEMBER account → print warning, run limited checks
  - If throws `AWSOrganizationsNotInUseException`: standalone account → print warning, run limited checks
- FR-2.3: Discover regions by calling `ec2.describeRegions(Filters=[{Name: 'opt-in-status', Values: ['opt-in-not-required']}])`
  - Returns only default-enabled regions (not opt-in regions)
  - If this call fails, fall back to a partition-specific list: 17 commercial regions, 2 GovCloud regions, or 2 China regions
- FR-2.4: When NOT management account, run ONLY these checks:
  - FR-6.2 (IAM Users)
  - FR-7.1 (CloudTrail exists)
  - FR-7.2 (CloudTrail is org trail — will be false since non-mgmt can't see org trails)
  - FR-7.3 (Config recorder)
  - FR-7.4 (Config delivery channel)
  - FR-7.5 (EC2 instances)
  - FR-7.6 (VPCs)
  - FR-3.1 and FR-3.2 also run in every mode. Management-account-only checks are skipped rather than synthesized as incomplete results.

### FR-3: Organization Governance Checks

### FR-10: Report Generation

- FR-10.1: Generate an interactive HTML report containing:
  - **Maturity Level Score** (top of report): Level 1-5 with name, progress bar to next level, and specific next steps
  - **Radar/Spider Chart**: 7-axis chart showing % completion per WA Foundations capability:
    - Axis 1: Multi-Account Environment (FND01) — checks FR-3.1-3.12
    - Axis 2: Identity & Access Management (FND02) — checks FR-3.6, FR-3.9, FR-4.5, FR-4.7, FR-6.1, FR-6.2
    - Axis 3: Central Observability (FND03) — checks FR-4.1, FR-7.1, FR-7.2 (limited in Phase 1)
    - Axis 4: Resource & Inventory Management (FND04) — checks FR-3.7, FR-3.8, FR-4.2, FR-4.9
    - Axis 5: Security & Compliance (FND05) — checks FR-4.1, FR-4.3, FR-4.4, FR-7.1-7.4, FR-3.4
    - Axis 6: Cloud Financial Management (FND06) — checks FR-3.7, FR-4.10, FR-7.7
    - Axis 7: Networking & Connectivity (FND07) — no Phase 1 checks (shows 0%, gap highlighted)
    - Score per axis = (passing checks in that capability / total checks for that capability) × 100
    - Note: A single check CAN contribute to multiple axes (e.g., CloudTrail is both Observability and Security) — axes are independent dimensions, not a partition
    - Implementation: inline SVG embedded in the HTML; the report has no external CDN dependency
    - Reference pattern: https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-observability-assessment
  - Executive summary: total checks, passed, failed, completion percentage
  - Table with columns: Check Name, Description, Status, Required (yes/no), Level of Effort, Remediation Link
  - Filter controls: show all / complete only / incomplete only
  - Console table print (same as original CFAT): columns `check`, `status`, `required`, `loe`
  - Light/dark mode toggle (CSS only, no JS framework required)
- FR-10.2: Generate CSV file with ALL check results (same columns as HTML table) — filename: `wafa-checks.csv`
- FR-10.3: Generate raw JSON file with full assessment data — filename: `wafa-raw.json`
- FR-10.4: Upload all files to S3 bucket: `s3://{bucket}/{account_id}/wafa-report.html`, `wafa-checks.csv`, `wafa-raw.json`
- FR-10.5: If SNS topic exists and `EmailAddress` parameter was provided, publish completion notification with S3 URL

### FR-11: Maturity Level Scoring

Based on the AWS Well-Architected Foundations maturity model (March 2026). Maps check results to a maturity level and shows customers their current position + what to do next.

- FR-11.1: Calculate maturity level based on these criteria:

  **Level 1 — Base** (any of these true):
  - FR-3.1 incomplete (no org) OR
  - Only 1-2 accounts OR
  - No OU structure at all

  **Level 2 — Established** (all required):
  - FR-3.1 complete (org exists)
  - FR-3.2 complete (management account identified)
  - FR-3.3 complete (4+ accounts)
  - At least 1 OU exists (any of FR-3.10, FR-3.11, FR-3.12)

  **Level 3 — Intermediate** (Level 2 + all required):
  - FR-3.6 complete (SCPs enabled)
  - FR-3.10 complete (Security OU)
  - FR-5.1 complete (Control Tower deployed)
  - FR-3.7 complete (Tag Policy enabled)
  - FR-4.1 complete (CloudTrail org service)
  - FR-6.1 complete (IAM Identity Center configured)
  - FR-7.1 complete (CloudTrail exists)
  - FR-7.3 complete (Config recorder active)

  **Level 4 — Advanced** (Level 3 + all required):
  - FR-4.3 complete (GuardDuty org service)
  - FR-4.4 complete (Security Hub org service)
  - FR-4.5 complete (Access Analyzer org service)
  - FR-3.8 complete (Backup Policy enabled)
  - FR-3.9 complete (RCP enabled)
  - FR-6.2 complete (no IAM users in mgmt)
  - FR-7.5 complete (no EC2 in mgmt)
  - FR-7.6 complete (no VPCs in mgmt)
  - FR-5.2 complete (Control Tower not drifted)
  - FR-5.3 complete (Control Tower latest version)
  - ALL FR-4.x complete (all org services enabled)

  **Level 5 — Expert** (Level 4 + all required):
  - FR-8.1 complete (StackSets org access)
  - ALL checks returned by the current Phase 1 implementation are complete; both "incomplete" and "error" results prevent Level 5
  - Note: Full Level 5 validation requires Phase 2+ checks (root user, MFA, credential rotation) beyond Phase 1 scope

- FR-11.2: Report output includes:
  - Current level (1-5) with level name
  - Percentage progress toward next level (passing checks for next level / total needed for next level)
  - Ordered list of checks needed to reach next level (sorted by weight descending — highest impact first)

- FR-11.3: Maturity model definitions (shown in report):

  | Level | Name | Description |
  |-------|------|-------------|
  | 1 | Base | Single account or small number with no OU structure. No management account separation, no tagging, ad-hoc account creation. |
  | 2 | Established | AWS Organizations in place with OU structure. Management account separated. Basic tagging applied. Documented account creation process. |
  | 3 | Intermediate | OUs reflect security/infrastructure/workload separation. SCPs enforce guardrails. Control Tower automates provisioning. Tags enforced. |
  | 4 | Advanced | Preventive + detective controls together. Progressive controls across environments. Tag compliance monitored. Defined ownership processes. |
  | 5 | Expert | Controls, baselines, provisioning fully codified and continuously validated. Ephemeral environments on demand. Accurate metadata everywhere. |

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Security
- NFR-1.1: ReadOnly access ONLY — tool makes ZERO changes to the AWS environment (no creates, updates, deletes)
- NFR-1.2: IAM role uses explicit action list (never `Action: "*"` or `Resource: "*"` except where required by API)
- NFR-1.3: S3 bucket: AES256 encryption, `BlockPublicAcls: true`, `BlockPublicPolicy: true`, `IgnorePublicAcls: true`, `RestrictPublicBuckets: true`, versioning enabled
- NFR-1.4: All data stays in the customer's AWS account — no external API calls or data exfiltration

### NFR-2: Performance
- NFR-2.1: Complete full assessment (all checks) within 2 minutes
- NFR-2.2: Use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for per-region checks (EC2, VPC, CloudTrail, Config run across the enabled regions, typically ~17 commercial regions)
- NFR-2.3: Single API call for org service checks (one `listAWSServiceAccessForOrganization` call serves all FR-4.x checks)

### NFR-3: Reliability
- NFR-3.1: Configure botocore standard retries for throttling and transient failures with `AWS_RETRY_MODE=standard` and `AWS_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5` unless the caller already set those variables
- NFR-3.2: On AccessDenied or another check-level API failure, mark that check as "error" with the exception message and continue to the next check; do not convert an unknown state to "incomplete"
- NFR-3.3: On a region-not-enabled response (`InvalidRegion`, `OptInRequired`, or equivalent message), skip that region and continue scanning
- NFR-3.4: Never crash the entire assessment due to a single check failure — always produce a report even if partial

### NFR-4: Extensibility
- NFR-4.1: Each check is a standalone function returning the Check Metadata Schema (below)
- NFR-4.2: All check metadata (name, description, weight, loe, required, remediationLink) is defined in the function — not in a separate config file
- NFR-4.3: Report generator takes a `List[CheckResult]` and has no knowledge of individual check logic
- NFR-4.4: Adding a new check = adding a new function + calling it from `main.py` — no other files to modify

## Check Metadata Schema

Every check function returns exactly this structure:

```python
{
    "check": str,  # Human-readable name (e.g. "Service Control Policies enabled")
    "description": str,  # One sentence explaining what is verified
    "status": str,  # EXACTLY one of: "complete" | "incomplete" | "error"
    "required": bool,  # true = must-have for well-architected org, false = recommended
    "weight": int,  # Priority 1-6 (6 = critical, 1 = nice-to-have)
    "loe": int,  # Level of effort to fix: 1 = minutes, 6 = weeks
    "remediationLink": str,  # Full URL to AWS documentation for remediation
}
```

When status is "error", an additional field is included:
```python
    "error": str            # Error message (e.g. "AccessDenied")
```

## Well-Architected Foundations Alignment

This assessment maps to the AWS whitepaper "Organizing Your AWS Environment Using Multiple Accounts" (April 2025). Each check traces to a specific best practice:

| Check | Well-Architected Best Practice | Category |

### Checks from the whitepaper not yet in WAFA (candidates for future addition)

Based on the **AWS Well-Architected Foundations** document (March 2026, 292 pages, 7 capabilities, 43 best practices), WAFA currently covers ~37% (16/43). Below are the gaps prioritized by customer impact and implementation feasibility.

#### Priority 1 — High value, automatable via API (Phase 2)

| WA Best Practice | What to check | API needed |
|---|---|---|
| FND02-BP01: Protect root users | Root user has no access keys, MFA enabled | `iam.getAccountSummary()` → `AccountAccessKeysPresent`, `AccountMFAEnabled` |
| FND02-BP02: Strong sign-in (MFA) | MFA enforced for IAM users (if any exist) | `iam.listMFADevices()` per user |
| FND03-BP02: Cross-account observability | Config Aggregator exists | `config.describeConfigurationAggregators()` |
| FND05-BP01: Emergency access | Break-glass role or account exists | Check for role named `*emergency*` or `*break-glass*` |
| FND01-BP04: Sandbox/Suspended OUs | Suspended OU and/or Sandbox OU exist | Already detected by WAFA (just not reported) |
| FND05-BP10: Encryption standards | KMS key policy exists, S3 default encryption | `kms.listKeys()`, `s3.getBucketEncryption()` |

#### Priority 2 — Medium value, requires multi-account scan (Phase 2+)

| WA Best Practice | What to check | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| FND02-BP05: Least privilege | Overly permissive policies (admin access) | Requires scanning member accounts |
| FND02-BP08: Credential rotation | Access keys older than 90 days | `iam.listAccessKeys()` + age check |
| FND05-BP05: Non-compliant resources | Config non-compliant rule count | `config.getComplianceSummaryByConfigRule()` |
| FND04-BP05: Service quota management | Service Quotas configured/monitored | `service-quotas.listServiceQuotas()` |
| FND05-BP07: Vulnerability management | Inspector enabled | `inspector2.listMembers()` or org service check |

#### Priority 3 — Lower value or hard to automate (Phase 3+)

| WA Best Practice | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| FND02-BP04: Lifecycle-based access | Process check, not API-automatable |
| FND02-BP07: Data perimeter | Complex — requires VPC endpoint policy analysis |
| FND02-BP10: Machine identity federation | Workload-specific, not org-level |
| FND03-BP01: Observability standards | Policy/process, not automatable |
| FND04-BP03: Shared patterns/repos | Organizational, not API-checkable |
| FND04-BP04: Patch management | Requires SSM inventory across accounts |
| FND04-BP07: Cross-Region failover | Architecture-specific, not generalizable |
| FND04-BP08: Resilience testing | Process check (FIS configured, etc.) |
| FND05-BP09: Forensics capabilities | Requires dedicated forensics account check |
| FND06-BP04: License optimization | License Manager — niche |
| FND06-BP05: Org optimization metrics | CUR analysis — separate tool |
| FND06-BP06: Commitment discounts | Savings Plans/RI — separate tool |
| FND07-BP01-03: Networking | TGW/VPC/DNS — architecture-specific, not one-size-fits-all |

#### Coverage Roadmap

| Phase | Coverage | Best Practices |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1 (now)** | 37% (16/43) | WAFA baseline — org structure, services, Control Tower, basic hygiene |
| **Phase 2 (fast-follow)** | ~56% (24/43) | + root user, MFA, Config aggregator, emergency access, encryption, Sandbox/Suspended OUs, multi-account scanning |
| **Phase 3 (future)** | ~70% (30/43) | + credential rotation, least privilege analysis, vulnerability management, service quotas, non-compliant resources |
| **Not automatable** | Remaining ~30% | Process/policy checks that require human judgment |

**Decision:** Phase 1 establishes the WAFA baseline. Priority 1 gaps become Phase 2 targets (most are single API calls, easy to add once the framework exists).

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (run locally, no AWS credentials needed)

- Use `pytest` with `moto` or `unittest.mock` to mock boto3 responses
- Each check function gets its own test file
- Test cases per check:
  - Happy path: API returns data → check returns "complete"
  - Negative path: API returns empty/missing → check returns "incomplete"
  - Error path: API throws exception → check returns "error" with message
  - Edge cases: pagination, partial data, unexpected formats

```

### Unit Test Pattern

```python
# tests/unit/test_organization.py
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from src.checks.organization import check_scp_enabled


@patch("src.checks.organization.boto3.client")
def test_scp_enabled_complete(mock_client):
    mock_client.return_value.list_roots.return_value = {
        "Roots": [
            {
                "Id": "r-abc",
                "PolicyTypes": [
                    {"Type": "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY", "Status": "ENABLED"}
                ],
            }
        ]
    }
    result = check_scp_enabled()
    assert result["status"] == "complete"
    assert result["check"] == "Service Control Policies enabled"


@patch("src.checks.organization.boto3.client")
def test_scp_enabled_incomplete(mock_client):
    mock_client.return_value.list_roots.return_value = {
        "Roots": [{"Id": "r-abc", "PolicyTypes": []}]
    }
    result = check_scp_enabled()
    assert result["status"] == "incomplete"
```

### Integration Test (manual, requires real AWS account)

- Run against a management account with an org configured
- Triggered manually: `pytest tests/integration/ --profile <aws-profile>`
- Validates: real API responses parse correctly, pagination works, permissions sufficient
- NOT run in CI/CD — only by developer before release

### When to Write Tests

- Kiro writes unit tests ALONGSIDE each check implementation (not after)
- Every check function ships with at least 3 test cases (complete, incomplete, error)
- Maturity scoring tests cover all 5 levels with fixture data
- Report generation tests verify HTML contains expected elements (chart, table, maturity badge)

### Test Dependencies

```
pytest>=7.0
moto>=5.0  # AWS service mocking
pytest-cov  # Coverage reporting
```

## AWS API Permissions Required

Exact actions needed for the assessment IAM role (the deployment role has separate infrastructure permissions):

```
sts:GetCallerIdentity
organizations:DescribeOrganization
organizations:ListAWSServiceAccessForOrganization
organizations:ListRoots
organizations:ListAccounts
organizations:ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent
organizations:ListDelegatedAdministrators
organizations:ListDelegatedServicesForAccount
controltower:ListLandingZones
controltower:GetLandingZone
cur:DescribeReportDefinitions
bcm-data-exports:ListExports
cloudtrail:DescribeTrails
config:DescribeConfigurationRecorders
config:DescribeConfigurationRecorderStatus
config:DescribeDeliveryChannels
config:DescribeDeliveryChannelStatus
ec2:DescribeInstances
ec2:DescribeVpcs
ec2:DescribeRegions
iam:ListUsers
sso:ListInstances
cloudformation:DescribeOrganizationsAccess
s3:PutObject
s3:GetBucketAcl
s3:GetBucketLocation
s3:GetBucketVersioning
s3:GetObject
s3:GetObjectVersion
s3:GetObjectTagging
s3:GetObjectVersionTagging
```

Note: `s3:PutObject` is the ONLY write permission — used to upload results to the assessment S3 bucket.
